Part 1. Activity 1:

Question 1:

-   We could, but that would take a lot of time and extra effort. If we give permissions each person individually we have to do the same work many times, if we have 10 users we need to do the same thing 10 times. With roles it only takes a few seconds once we assign permissions to roles and after that all we have to do is just to give that role to the user

Question 2:

-   Authentication is the concept of checking users if they are allowed to enter a certain place. Authorization means what they can do and con not do at this place. For example a teacher may enter a crm platform but cannot change any information, this user is authenticated but not authorized to do anything!

Question 3:

-   Example 1: CRM platform. There are usually different roles on a crm platform like: admins, teachers, students, parents, and what they can do differ from one another!
-   Example 2: telegram groups and channels. There are 3 different roles: owners(who has the full access to everything), admins and users!
-   Example 3: E-commerce platforms. There may be a user, admin, execs and so on!


Part 2. Activity 1: 

-   None: we may give this to a demo user. This is person is only allowed to see what the webpage looks like, nothing else!

-   Create: These following three permissions are usually give to admins who are allowed to manipulate items and data on the webpage(or any platform)!
-   Update: admins!
-   Delete: admins!
-   Full Access: this permission may be given(or hold) to owners(creaters) of the platform!

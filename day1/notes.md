The most useful thing today was how we can easely create and delete tables, folders and items. UI is very well-organized!

The most challanging thing was learning how ucode data types map to actual database data types. Because on Ucode there are many data types that can not be found in the actual database. For example: money, Qr, Internation phone and so on!

I want to learn more about Ucode data types and how they are mapped to actual database data types!
